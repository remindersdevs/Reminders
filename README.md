## Todo
- Windows port (Need to look into dbus support on Windows)
- Add a debug mode and make it easier to get logs
- Maybe make a GNOME Shell extension that lets you view your reminders (This probably will never happen)
- Maybe integrate the search with GNOME Shell (Also probably not happening)

If you want to contribute anything, just open a pull request. Depending on what you are going to contribute, you might want to [email me](mailto:dgsasha04@gmail.com) first. This will let me help you get started and it will also help me make sure that multiple people aren't working on the same feature without knowing it.
