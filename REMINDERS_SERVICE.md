# Reminders DBus Service version 5.0 Documentation
name: io.github.remindersdevs.Reminders.Service

interface: io.github.remindersdevs.Reminders.Service

object: /io/github/remindersdevs/Reminders/Service

Currently this is only packaged with Reminders and anyone who wants to use it will have to have the full Reminders app installed. The reason this exists is to allow integrating the Reminders app with desktop environments through extensions.

At some point I might separate this from Reminders and offer it as a standalone library, but until then you probably shouldn't use it if you are making your own reminder app.

This service will have some breaking changes made to it at times, so make sure you use the GetVersion method to check that the right version is installed.

Newer versions of this service should usually be compatible with apps that expect an older version. If this ever changes, the bus name will be updated.

## Enums
